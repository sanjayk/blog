Jeff Bezos gave us the 2 Pizza Rule. If you can't feed your team with two pizzas, it's too big.

For 20 years, this was gospel. Engineering managers would do the math: *"Nine people... that's 2.25 pizzas... somebody's gotta go."*

The logic was sound. Small teams communicate better. Every person you add creates more channels, more meetings, more friction. Keep it tight. Two pizzas. Done.

**But the 2 Pizza Rule assumed humans.**

Last Tuesday I spun up 30 Claude agents on a refactoring task.

Thirty.

Some were analyzing dependencies. Some were rewriting modules. Some were running tests. A few were reviewing each other's work. One agent's entire job was to summarize what the other agents did.

At one point I checked the logs and found 29 of them in what I can only describe as a *heated disagreement* about whether to use `forEach` or `map`. Meanwhile, agent #30 had quietly shipped the PR while the others were distracted.

Twenty-nine philosophers. One plumber.

Do these count as team size, Jeff? Do I need 15 pizzas? **Do agents eat pizza?**

Here's what nobody warned me about: agents develop *politics*.

Not consciously. But when you have multiple agents touching the same codebase, their outputs start colliding. Agent A refactors a function. Agent B, working on something adjacent, reads the old version and makes assumptions. Agent C runs the tests and catches the mess. Agent D opens an issue *on Agent A's work*.

I've watched agents form factions in the logs. Not because they're sentient - because their tasks have dependencies, and dependencies create conflict, and conflict looks the same whether it's humans in a sprint planning meeting or language models in a terminal.

The difference is speed. What takes a human team two weeks to fuck up, agents can fuck up in four minutes.

But you can also *fix* it in four minutes. You see the conflict forming, you intervene, you redirect. Or you grab your coffee and let them sort it out. Sometimes they do.

So here's my new heuristic. I call it the **1 Burrito Rule**:

> If you can't finish your burrito before the agents finish the sprint, you've shipped.

This isn't entirely a joke.

My workflow now looks like this: Define what I want. Spawn the swarm. Eat lunch. Check the PR. Maybe nudge a few things. Ship.

The human's job isn't to write the code anymore. It's to:
- Know what "done" looks like
- Point the swarm in the right direction
- Break ties when they argue
- Decide if the output is actually good

That loop takes... about one burrito.

The weird part is realizing that "team size" was never about people. It was about *attention*.

The 2 Pizza Rule worked because small teams meant fewer demands on everyone's attention. Less coordination. Less context-switching. More focus.

With agents, you can have a "team" of 50 that requires less attention than a team of 5 humans. Or you can have 5 agents on a gnarly problem that thrash worse than any human team I've managed.

The variable isn't headcount. It's how much of *your* attention the work demands.

A task that's embarrassingly parallel? Throw 50 agents at it. You barely need to watch.

A task with tight dependencies and ambiguous requirements? Even 3 agents will have you babysitting constantly.

The question isn't "how many agents" - it's "how much babysitting."

I think about Brooks's Law a lot now. *"Adding people to a late project makes it later."* The insight was that communication overhead grows faster than productivity.

Agents don't eliminate that overhead. They just make it visible in a way human teams never were.

When Agent 7 is blocked on Agent 3, you can *see* it. When Agent 12 duplicates work, you catch it in seconds. The dysfunction that takes human teams months to diagnose plays out in your terminal in minutes.

It's humbling, honestly. All the problems we blamed on "process" or "culture" or "that one guy who won't update his tickets" - turns out a lot of it is just... the physics of coordinated work. Agents have the same problems. They just can't blame anyone.

---

The 2 Pizza Rule was brilliant for its era. It encoded a truth about human coordination limits into a food metaphor that executives could remember.

But it measured team size in bodies.

The 1 Burrito Rule measures team size in attention.

One developer, thirty agents, a mass of emergent politics in the logs, and somewhere in the chaos - a PR that actually ships.

Welcome to the swarm. Your burrito's getting cold.
