When building APIs that need to handle millions of requests, the decisions you make early on can have lasting impacts on your system's scalability and maintainability.

## The Foundation: Design Principles

Great APIs start with great design. Here are the core principles we follow...

### 1. Resource-Oriented Design

Think in terms of resources, not actions. Your API should model the domain, not the database.

### 2. Versioning from Day One

Even if you think you won't need it, version your API. We use URL-based versioning (v1, v2) for clarity.

## Performance Patterns

Here's what we learned about keeping APIs fast under load...

### Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting early. We use a token bucket algorithm with Redis to track usage across distributed systems.

### Response Caching

Cache aggressively, invalidate precisely. Use ETags and Last-Modified headers to enable conditional requests.

## Conclusion

Building scalable APIs is about making thoughtful tradeoffs and learning from production. Start simple, measure everything, and iterate based on real usage patterns.
