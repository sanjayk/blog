Kubernetes is powerful, but it's also complex. After a year of running production workloads on K8s, here's what we learned.

## The Good

### Resource Efficiency

Our infrastructure costs dropped by 30% thanks to better resource utilization and autoscaling.

### Deployment Velocity

Rolling deployments and easy rollbacks mean we ship with confidence. We went from weekly deploys to multiple times per day.

## The Challenges

### Complexity

The learning curve is steep. Invest in training and documentation. We spent 3 months just getting comfortable with the basics.

### Debugging

When things go wrong, they can be hard to debug. Good observability is non-negotiable. We use Prometheus and Grafana extensively.

## Key Takeaways

- Start with managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE) unless you have a dedicated platform team
- Invest heavily in monitoring and alerting from day one
- Don't over-engineer—start simple and add complexity only when needed
- Document everything for your future self and your team
