Product-led growth isn't just a buzzword—it's a fundamental shift in how software companies go to market.

## What is PLG?

At its core, PLG means your product is the primary driver of customer acquisition, retention, and expansion.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Time to Value

Get users to their "aha moment" as quickly as possible. Every friction point in onboarding is a drop-off opportunity.

### 2. Product Experience

The product must be genuinely excellent. PLG doesn't work if your product isn't good enough to sell itself.

### 3. Built-in Virality

Make sharing and collaboration core to the experience, not an afterthought.

## What We Learned

After implementing PLG strategies, we saw a 3x increase in organic signups and a 40% improvement in activation rates. The key was obsessing over the first-time user experience.
