Not all metrics are created equal. Here's how we separate signal from noise in product analytics.

## The North Star Metric

Find the one metric that best represents value delivery to users. For us, it's weekly active teams, not just users.

## Leading vs Lagging Indicators

Track both. Lagging indicators (revenue, churn) tell you where you are. Leading indicators (engagement, feature adoption) tell you where you're going.

## Cohort Analysis

Always segment by cohort. Aggregate metrics hide important trends in user behavior over time.
