TypeScript is great, but it can also slow you down if not used carefully. Here's how we maintain velocity in a large TS codebase.

## Strict Mode is Your Friend

Enable strict mode from the start. It catches bugs before they reach production and makes refactoring safer.

## Type Inference > Explicit Types

Let TypeScript infer types when possible. Only add explicit types when they add clarity or are required.

## Utility Types

Master utility types like Partial, Pick, Omit, and ReturnType. They'll save you from writing repetitive type definitions.
